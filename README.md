My Drive Clone
This is a simplified, client-side, single-page application that mimics the core features of a file storage service like Google Drive. It provides a user-friendly interface for managing files, with a focus on demonstrating frontend logic for authentication, user-specific file handling, and a responsive design.

Note: This is a frontend-only project with a "mock" backend implemented using JavaScript's localStorage for data persistence. It is not a production-ready application and lacks the security and scalability of a real-world solution.

Features
User Authentication:

Sign Up: Users can create an account with a name, email, password, and date of birth.

Login: Registered users can log in to access their personalized file storage.

Logout: Users can securely log out of their account.

File Management:

File Upload: Users can upload files via a drag-and-drop area or a file input.

File Viewing: Uploaded files are displayed in a grid with corresponding icons (e.g., images, videos, general files).

New File/Folder Creation: Users can create new folders or generic files directly from the interface.

User Interface:

Responsive Design: The application's layout is designed to work seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

Profile Menu: A user profile menu shows the logged-in user's email and provides a logout option.

Google-like Aesthetics: The UI incorporates a similar look and feel to Google Drive, including Material Icons and a clean layout.

Technologies Used
HTML5: For the application's structure.

CSS3: For styling and layout, including Flexbox and CSS Grid for responsiveness.

JavaScript: For all client-side logic, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and simulating backend functionality with localStorage.

Material Icons: For a clean and modern icon set.
